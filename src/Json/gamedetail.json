Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/HarvestBuildPaint.png?t=1622776125\" /><br><br> By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/PlantFarmGrow.png?t=1622776125\" /><br><br>Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/Summon.png?t=1622776125\" /><br><br>By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK\u2019s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/Tribes.png?t=1622776125\" /><br><br>Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/RPG.png?t=1622776125\" /><br><br>All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new &quot;Engrams&quot; to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D &quot;Explorer Notes&quot;. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/HardcoreMechanics.png?t=1622776125\" /><br><br>Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/ExploreAndDiscover.png?t=1622776125\" /><br><br>The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you\u2019ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/LargeWorld.png?t=1622776125\" /><br><br>On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/RobustSteamWorkshop.png?t=1622776125\" /><br><br>You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example.

It works by controlling the \u201crandom\u201d events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the <strong>AI Storyteller</strong>. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.<br><br><strong>Your colonists are not professional settlers</strong> \u2013 they\u2019re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You\u2019ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.<br><br><strong>Each person\u2019s background is tracked and affects how they play.</strong> A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill \u2013 but he does that very well.<br><br><strong>Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships.</strong> Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.<br><br><strong>The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator.</strong> You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.<br><br><strong>Travel across the planet.</strong> You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.<br><br><strong>You can tame and train animals.</strong> Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.<br><br><strong>People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment.</strong> They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.<br><br><strong>Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities.</strong> Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.<br><br><strong>You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent.</strong> A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.<br><br>And there's much more than that!

It consists of a huge universe, simulated from the bottom up. Hundreds of stations, and thousands of ships, trade goods among themselves. Prices change based on supply and demand; resources are mined and processed in several stages.

Focus on exploration, make money with illegal trading and theft, command large battle fleets or become the greatest entrepreneur ever. It's all up to <strong>you</strong> to decide.<br><br></li><li><strong>Fly every ship</strong><br>X4 allows you to <strong>fly all ships personally</strong>. From small scouts over a wide range of ship classes up to the biggest carrier, everything can be piloted from the cockpit or an external view. A big focus in the development of X4 has been to achieve a <strong>seamless and immersive experience when moving between ships</strong>.

After gaining enough money through fighting or trading, most players want to <strong>establish their own economy</strong> and <strong>start influencing the universe on a larger scale</strong>. In X4, it is now possible to be completely <strong>free and creative</strong>. Stations can be constructed from a variety of modules, be it production modules, living sections, docks or many other types of parts. The <strong>powerful new map system</strong> allows you to drag and connect modules using a connection system to design your own unique creations. Ships also offer a variety of upgrades.

Wares produced by hundreds of stations and transported by thousands of ships are actually traded by NPCs and prices develop based on this simulated economy. This is the foundation of our living and breathing universe. Now with X4, we have taken another, massive step. For the first time in any X game,<strong> all parts of the NPC economy are manufactured from resources</strong>. Ships, weapons, upgrades, ammo and even stations. You name it.

Once you've unlocked teleportation, you can jump from ship to ship a lot quicker and experience all the critical situations your NPCs encounter first hand.

Build, harvest, and take resources from an environment where your every action affects the world around you. An imminent meteor strike threatens global destruction.  Can you save the world without destroying it in the process?<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/382310/extras/Meteor_Rise.png?t=1616072735\" /><br><br>Construct buildings and towns, tend to your farm, hunt wildlife, build infrastructure and transportation, craft clothing, build power plants, and research new technologies. Specialize in a craft and trade your goods to other players. Develop your civilization and sculpt your planet.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/382310/extras/OtterFloat.png?t=1616072735\" /><br><br>As your civilization grows, you\u2019ll need to analyze data from the simulation; evaluating the impact you have on your world.  Use this data as evidence in proposed laws, restricting harmful activities without disrupting the advancement of technology. Balance your individual needs with the needs of community, all while maintaining the state of the ecosystem. The future of your world is in your hands.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/382310/extras/A_Rich_Simulation.png?t=1616072735\" /><br>Every organism in Eco exists as part of a detailed simulation; a disruption in one species can have cascading effects across the planet. Chop down all the trees, and habitats for creatures will be destroyed. Pollute the rivers with mining waste, and your farms will become poisoned and die. The ecosystem supplies the resources you and your community will need to stop the meteor.  Manage your pollution, mining waste, hunting, and resource collection to balance your effect on this system.  <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/382310/extras/Mine_Tailings.gif?t=1616072735\" /><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/382310/extras/Backed_By_Science.png?t=1616072735\" /><br>Eco is built on a rich ecological simulation. All the data generated from the interaction of plants, animals, climate, and players can be searched and analyzed using in-game graphs and heat-maps. Use the collected information as scientific evidence support to proposed laws.  The ability to successfully debate using scientific evidence is your greatest weapon against the destruction of your world.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/382310/extras/DataBorder.gif?t=1616072735\" /><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/382310/extras/Player_Run_Government.png?t=1616072735\" /><br>Establish and maintain your own set of laws and government, which are enforced automatically by the game. Draft a proposal to limit clear-cutting in a protected forest, incentivize green energy solutions over fossil fuels by providing tax subsidies and penalties. Participate in elections for world leadership, allowing you to set tax rates and allocate community money.  Use a programmable law system to make dynamic and flexible rules for the community, passing them by vote.   Construct a wide variety of governments; from tightly-regulated dictator-states, to tax-and-spend subsidy programs, or even lawless communities relying on trust.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/382310/extras/Gov2.gif?t=1616072735\" /><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/382310/extras/Learn_and_Specialize.png?t=1616072735\" /><br>Your skills increase based on your food and shelter. By consuming a highly nutritious variety of food and building an elaborate home you will rapidly increase your skill points. Skill points can be spent on skills like farming, hunting, trade, engineering, research, and more. Contribute to the greater good while increasing your own personal success.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/382310/extras/Items_Icons.gif?t=1616072735\" /><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/382310/extras/A_Community_Driven_Economy.png?t=1616072735\" /><br>In the player-run economy, you achieve the most when you specialize and trade both goods and services. Create stores to buy and sell goods you need asynchronously with other players. Setup contracts within the game\u2019s quest-like labor market, soliciting other players to perform specialized work for you in exchange for payment. Build complex crafting machines and charge a fee for players to use them. A thriving economy in Eco can be both a powerful tool for progress, or a dangerous threat to the environment.<br><br>To grease the wheels of commerce, you can create your own currencies, backed by fiat or by resources.  Manage the value of your currency relative to others by setting exchange rates at asynchronous currency exchanges. Sell items at stores and collect credit from other players.  Eco is designed for rich asynchronous play, allowing many players of many disciplines to contribute to one another\u2019s goals at separate or simultaneous times. <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/382310/extras/Mint.png?t=1616072735\" /><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/382310/extras/A_World_With_Consequences.png?t=1616072735\" /><br>All of the world\u2019s resources originate from its environment, which is affected by your actions.  While a meteor looms over head \u2014  set to strike the planet in thirty days \u2014 a more subtle threat grows from player-interaction with the environment.  Without careful attention, ecological destruction can destroy civilization before the meteor even strikes.  To ultimately succeed, you and your community will need to use the tools of government and economy to find a balance between progress and protection.<br><br><strong>Included Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Online Multiplayer - Collaborate online with a community of players.<br></li><li>Local Singleplayer - Build your own world, with the option to invite friends.<br></li><li>Dedicated Server Included - Host your own Eco worlds.<br></li><li>Over 30 different craft tables, with hundreds of recipes.<br></li><li>Hundreds of items, skills, craft tables, and building blocks.<br></li><li>A simulated ecosystem with dozens of unique species.<br></li><li>With limited carrying capacity, players must create vehicles and networks of roads to transport materials.<br></li><li>Create your own backed or fiat currencies, using them as a means of exchange in the economy.<br></li><li>Build stores where you can sell your excess items for a profit.<br></li><li>Eat varied and nutritious food and build ever larger homes to increase your skills.<br></li><li>Create contracts for jobs that you would like players with different skill-specialties to accomplish for you.

While city and society management will consume most of the ruler\u2019s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state.<br><br>What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>MAKE THE LAW</strong></h2>Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society.

The maze lives right on the edge of the Local Fairgrounds, and they are hoping to open it up as an attraction.<br><br>Built on the land of Ethel Fir. A twice widowed woman who died in 1935 leaving no will and no heir. It's said the maze was a crazed project she had worked away at for years before her death. She had fervently planted and shaped the trees muttering about looky loos, and nosey brats as it grew bigger each year, surrounding her house and grounds, and slowly growing taller and taller. After nearly 8 years without anyone seeing her, the local authorities assumed her dead, and entered the maze. They found her home in a state of disrepair, food clearly long rotten, and it appeared no one had lived in it for quite a long time. They searched the home, and what they could of the maze itself, but failed to find her body or any information regarding her death. Without a will in place, her property was left to the state, and turned into a local park, open to the fair when it visited town.<br><br>It's said that from time to time kids will wander in on a dare, or couples will enter trying to find old Ethel's home as a quiet place to be together. Often they come out safe and sound, if a little excitable, but the town has always had a higher than normal rate of missing persons. No one has ever been found in the maze. In the light of day it's simply an overgrown hedge, and a dilapidated home from the late 1800s.<br><br>This year the maze has been designated as an attraction and the Fair needs some help setting up after previous employees have either quit or disappeared.", "genre": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "Early Access"], "metacritic_url": null, "metacritic_score": null, "coming_soon": false, "date": "28 Oct, 2020"},

{"game_id": 376210, "name": "The Isle", "required_age": 0, "developers": ["Afterthought LLC"], "is_free": false, "about_the_game": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>The Isle: A World Designed to Kill You</strong></h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/extras/Underline.png?t=1604498608\" /><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/extras/StoreImageWorld01.jpg?t=1604498608\" /><br>The Isle is intended to be a gritty, open-world survival horror game. Explore vast landscapes of dense forest and open plains, traverse treacherous mountains and wade through dark swamps where horrors lurk. Hidden within are ruins that hold insight as to what came before. Through it all, keep in mind there is only one goal: survive. <br><br>There is little in the way of hand holding or ulterior precepts to alter play styles or purpose. It's kill or be killed. In the end, the only one you can trust is yourself. Over the course of development the islands and their inhabitants will radically change, ever-evolving as players themselves learn how to flourish and thrive. Your mistakes will be punished. Expect no survivors.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Massive Prehistoric Multiplayer</strong></h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/extras/Underline.png?t=1604498608\" /><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/extras/StoreImageDanger.jpg?t=1604498608\" /><br>Become the beast within. When joining The Isle, you can play as one of dozens of unique creatures, from tiny darting herbivores like Dryosaurus to blood-thirsty giants such as T. Rex or Allosaurus (with many more still to come!) As a dinosaur, you'll be the epitome of majestic, cunning and ferocious. Use your natural abilities and senses to stay off the menu and grow into a stronger, more capable creature.<br><br>Engage with a living prehistoric ecosystem as you become either predator or prey on servers featuring up to 100+ players, all of them as hungry and dangerous as you. Form packs/herds, create nests, defend your offspring, hunt, and claim territory. A single mistake can spell your demise.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Survival or Sandbox?</strong></h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/extras/Underline.png?t=1604498608\" /><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/extras/StoreImageFuture.jpg?t=1604498608\" /><br>The Isle's core game mode is Survival, a tense and difficult experience where you need to grow fast or die young. Dinosaurs in Survival mode progress through several life stages, starting out small and vulnerable. Use your scent ability, night vision and wits to survive long enough to grow, becoming more powerful and unlock new abilities such as nesting. Because of the time needed to develop a full character life cycle, not every creature is or will be playable in Survival, though more will be added in future updates. <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/extras/StoreImageSandbox.jpg?t=1604498608\" /><br>However, sometimes you don't want to struggle to survive, or you don't have the time to go through a dinosaur's whole life story. And that's okay. For players who want a less intense experience, Sandbox mode lets you play an expanded roster of dinosaurs (and soon humans!). You can jump right in as an adult super predator or a peaceful giant, with no major penalties or consequences from dying. We won't judge.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A Global Community Story</strong></h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/extras/Underline.png?t=1604498608\" /><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/extras/StoreImageStory.jpg?t=1604498608\" /><br>The Isle features a narrative told strictly through the environment, achievable only through immense cooperation among players. Are you stranded? Can you just leave? What is AE? How did the dinosaurs get here? What is the distant call that pierces the night? <br><br>It will take the entire community to answer these mysteries and unravel the purpose to their being on The Isle, and each discovery will directly affect the future of the game's storyline.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Future Development Goals</strong></h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/extras/Underline.png?t=1604498608\" /><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/extras/pteranodon_promo_2.jpg?t=1604498608\" /><br>We realize that there is a long road ahead, and a lot of work to be done to turn this into the game we want it to be. Throughout development, we will be adding a lot more to The Isle and incorporating user feedback in how we evolve the experience. Some of our planned features include:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Playable aquatic and aerial creatures<br></li><li>Even more playable dinosaurs with complete life cycles<br></li><li>Two new playable factions: modern humans &amp; the indigenous<br></li><li>Evolve into advanced &quot;strain&quot; versions of certain dinosaurs<br></li><li>Realistic dinosaur AI that uses complex behaviours<br></li><li>Additional world biome types such as thick jungles<br></li><li>Dynamic aerial drop-in spawn system<br></li><li>Global in-game world quest<br></li><li>Localization of all in-game menus &amp; text<br></li><li>Better accessibility &amp; customization options<br></li><li>Steam Achievements, Trading Cards, Emotes<br></li><li>Mod support using Steam Workshop</li></ul><br>All that and more are on our radar going forward. We started with a plan of just a mere handful of playable carnivores, but based on player demand we expanded our scope, increased that number greatly and introduced herbivorous dinosaurs as well. Listening to our community has been instrumental in guiding our process and helped to correct our mistakes, and we hope that together we can transform The Isle into the ultimate dinosaur game. <br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/376210/extras/Underline.png?t=1604498608\" /><br><i>--AE Core TX Received--<br>--End Promotional Protocol--</i><br><br><i>--SiGnaL InTeRrUpt--<br>-tHEeNdISnevErTheENDisNeVeRtHeEnDIsNev</i>-", "genre": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "Massively Multiplayer", "Simulation", "Early Access"], "metacritic_url": null, "metacritic_score": null, "coming_soon": false, "date": "1 Dec, 2015"},

Characters will grow and become stronger with experience, not just in their stats but their appearance too. <br><br></li><li><strong>Original take on the RTS-RPG hybrid genre.</strong> No &quot;hero&quot; characters with artificially stronger stats than everybody else- Every character and NPC you meet is potentially an equal, and has a name, a life. <br><br></li><li><strong>You are not the chosen one. </strong>You're not great and powerful. You don't have more 'hitpoints' than everyone else. You are not the center of the universe, and you are not special. Unless you work for it.<br><br></li><li><strong>Build a base</strong> where you can research new technologies, upgrade your defences and craft new gear. <br><br></li><li><strong>Purchase and upgrade your own buildings</strong> to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. <br><br></li><li><strong>Variation and possibilities of gameplay. </strong>Be good, be evil, be a businessman, be a thief, live in a town, live in the desert, travel alone, travel in hordes, build a fortress, raze a city. Devote yourself to freeing slaves, or maybe end up a slave yourself. <br><br></li><li><strong>Dynamic, ever changing world. </strong>Support or hinder whoever you wish, or keep to yourself, the world won't stop moving. This is not just a &quot;game&quot;, you are living and surviving in a simulated world.<br><br></li><li><strong>Get captured by cannibals and eaten alive</strong>, or sold off by slavers and forced to work in the mines. These are not scripted events, just a regular part of this chaotic world that ruins your life by chance. Anything can happen, yet anything can be overcome if you have the strength. <br><br></li><li><strong>Absolutely no Level-scaling.</strong> The world does not level up along with you, and the shops don't change their inventory to only items matching your level. At the start of the game almost everyone will be stronger than you, and survival will always be a struggle. The game won't hold your hand or help you when you're down. <br><br></li><li><strong>Realistic medical system that affects gameplay.</strong> A character with a wounded leg will limp or crawl and slow the party down, wounded arms means you must use your sword one-handed or not at all. Severe injuries will result in amputees needing robotic limb replacements. Blood loss means you can pass out, and the blood will attract predators. A character\u2019s stats are affected by equipment, encumbrance, blood loss, injuries and starvation. <br><br></li><li><strong>Intelligent AI</strong> that allows for characters to reason and work towards long-term goals and desires. Squads work together and carry their wounded to safety.

Paranormal Activity Helpers Incorporated, yeah sounds corny, but the pay is great. They said you won't ever be in any real danger, and they have tons of work right now. Your first job is at some old haunted house. There is a broker wanting to put the house for sale, but with everyone in the town spreading rumors of evil living inside the house, he needs some proof that it is safe. He actually seems creeped out himself. Anyway, he hired PAH Inc. to check the place out. You can go check it out alone if you'd like, but I would take at least 3 more friends with me. Check the place out, and if there is anything supernatural going on, try to bring evidence back to PAH Inc.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MYSTERY OF THE HOUSE</h2>This house was built over 100 years ago. The owners ran a funeral parlor. They held normal funeral services such as ceremonies, wakes, cremation and burying the dead. The rumor around town is that they also offered a very special service, a way to talk to your deceased loved one on last time. Several people paid for the service, and after some type of ritual, they were able to speak to the dead. Something apparently went wrong during one of the rituals. A person from town and the owners of the house disappeared and were never seen again. Over the last century, a few people that investigated the incident never returned. A few kids sneaking around the place claimed to hear laughter and see a little girl in the window. There probably isn't any truth to any of it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GAMEPLAY</h2>In Pacify, you will be running for your life around the narrow corridors of a dark, old house. There is a little girl that switches between good and evil roaming around. Different circumstances can cause her to change. Once the evil takes over, it will chase you and your friends all over the house. You must find a way to Pacify the evil and escape the house. As the game progresses, the evil gets smarter and faster.<br><br>Play alone in single player mode, or play with up to 3 more friends in multiplayer. In multiplayer mode, you can choose to play with or against your friends. Read the notes for clues about Pacifying the girl. Find and use keys, dolls, wood and matches to help you on your way. The girl can hear and see you. Stay out of sight, and stay as quiet as possible. Try different types of strategies to win.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Single Player Mode<br>You can go in the house alone, but the game will be difficult. You must do the work of 2-4 people all by yourself. It is possible though and very scary to take on the girl all alone! <br><br></li><li>Co-Op Mode<br>In co-op multiplayer, you work together trying to help each other escape the house. You can save each other from the girl by interrupting her when she catches someone. <br><br></li><li>PVP Mode<br>In pvp mode, everyone is an intern for PAH Inc. vying to get a full time position. The person that does the most work gets hired. You can push each other down and get in each other's way. Pushing a player on the floor stuns them for 5 seconds and causes them to drop their keys.</li></ul>", "genre": ["Action", "Adventure", "Casual", "Indie", "Strategy"], "metacritic_url": null, "metacritic_score": null, "coming_soon": false, "date": "22 Feb, 2019"},

Just like in boxing you have to get close; and use all your tactical knowledge of wind, your ship to slug it out face to face. Broadside weight matters, but even a smaller vessel can overcome the superior enemy by focusing on the enemy weak spots.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/311310/extras/Fleet_003.png?t=1622023660\" /><br><br>Absolutely no hackers.<br>Hacking is a killer of fun in PVP games. From the start we have build the tech around one main goal - complete elimination of hacking from PVP. We are very proud to say that we have succeeded. Naval Action is one of the few games where hacking is made impossible by design. Every battle action is calculated on the servers, even water and wave shapes.

Whether you\u2019re jumping out of a plane, arriving in a landing craft by sea, resupplying friendlies or operating a tank, you will find multiple reasons to drop back into the battlefield in this grand scaled representation of a WW2 setting never explored in a large multiplayer environment.<br><br>Post Scriptum will cover multiple theatres in the form of chapters, with the 1st Chapter \u201cThe Bloody Seventh\u201d being the original setting in Operation Market Garden, it covers the 1st Airborne, 82nd and 101st Airborne, the 9th Waffen SS and the Wehrmacht, with over 40 vehicles, 9 maps. The 2nd Chapter \u201cPlan Jaune\u201d covers the Invasion of France in 1940 and features the French Army as well as the Wehrmacht of 1940, dozens of new vehicles, 2 new maps with a 3rd still coming. The 3rd Chapter &quot;Day of Days&quot; which will cover the Invasion of Normandy in 1944, features new factions like the German Fallschirmj\u00e4gers and US 4th Infantry, each with new vehicles and a few new weapons, and with 2 new maps and a 3rd coming later, which adds to the already large selections of maps. Included in this new Chapter is a new game mode &quot;Invasion&quot; which puts a twist on the original game mode &quot;Offensive&quot;.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/736220/extras/FactionsGIFCh3.gif?t=1619806782\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Factions</h2>Fight in historically recreated WW2 battlefields with up to 80 players and choose between the British 1st Airborne Division, British XXX Corps, US 101st and 82nd Airborne Division, 4th Infantry, French Army or several branches of the German Army such as the Wehrmacht, the Waffen SS or Fallschirmj\u00e4gers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">_</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/736220/extras/Teamwork.gif?t=1619806782\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Teamwork</h2>In Post Scriptum, teamwork is paramount to achieve victory. Enrol as the commander and order gun runs or artillery to support your team, play as one of the many infantry roles, join a logistics section and fortify the battlefield with fortifications and emplacements and resupply the frontline or be one of the armoured crew members and crew a tank. Communicate with our in-game VoIP with your squad or use the local proximity fade to talk to players nearby to help the flow of battle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">_</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/736220/extras/ArmouredCombat.gif?t=1619806782\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Armored Combat</h2>Armoured vehicles played a tremendous role in WW2 and were feared due to their destructive nature. Join a tank section with 3 other players and crew multiple accurately modelled steel beasts as the driver, gunner or commander. Every vehicle features realistic values such as turret speed, armour thickness and type of rounds. Calculate the range of an enemy vehicle and shoot at its internal components to disable or destroy them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">_</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/736220/extras/Immersion.gif?t=1619806782\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tactical, Immersive &amp; Authentic</h2>Immersion is one of the fundamental key elements in Post Scriptum. Experience the authentic reproduction of an incoming Stuka siren or artillery cannons firing from afar. The piercing sound of an incoming heavy round cutting through the air past you. The cracks of bullets and shrapnel.

They can go to school or college to improve this level.

But be careful, as it is possible that if you buy or sell for high values you will affect the price of the commodity on the market. You may be able to purchase for a higher price or sell it cheaper.<br>As time increases, so does complexity. Some resources or products may become more expensive (as, for example, less human work is needed with advanced technologies), so later with more complexity, it may be necessary to be as self-sufficient as possible.", "genre": ["Indie", "Simulation", "Strategy", "Early Access"], "metacritic_url": null, "metacritic_score": null, "coming_soon": false, "date": "15 Mar, 2019"},

Can you handle the pressure, or will you fail miserably in a big bankruptcy?<br><br>As the owner and manager, you have a lot of daily responsibilities:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Choose the direction of your store</h2>Should it be a Shoe Store for the fashionable type, an Electronics Store for your everyday needs, or a giant Hypermarket that sells a bit of everything? Not everything will work. Trying to sell high-fashion, high-priced items in the poor part of town will not generate endless queues at your register. Will you try to dominate a competitive market, or go in a new direction?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Control the flow of goods</h2>A lot of things need to happen before an article gets taken home by a customer. First, you must select and order the goods. Then, you need to make sure you have storage space available so that you can receive and handle the delivered articles. The sales area must have the right displays and shelving to showcase and make the articles sell. Building a good relationship with your suppliers is critical to being able to sell your more exclusive items. Oh, and by the way, which article should be the first thing your customers see when they enter your store? First impressions count! So will you go with the bulk selling jeans, or the hyped-up silk shirt?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Attract more customers </h2>Build a strong reputation with your customers, and make your store the most popular one in town. A good marketing campaign, along with happy customers, will work wonders for your income. But don't oversell your store and its items. If you can't deliver what you promised, the customers will leave the store dissatisfied, and nothing ruins a store quicker than unhappy customers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Customer is King</h2>Create an enjoyable atmosphere for your customers to shop in, and theme your store, so they will know it is YOUR store they have entered. Make sure they receive the help they need, and that the lines for the registers don't grow too long. Manage the in-store marketing, so that both the fashionistas and the discount-hunters know where to go and which article to pick.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Manage your personnel</h2>The more successful your store becomes, the busier you\u2019ll get. At some point, you will have to hire more staff. Find interesting candidates among the applications. Conduct interviews, get a feel for the person and decide if they match the role you had in mind for them. Negotiate their salary and hire them. Keep them happy, and make sure they are not overworked. A great working climate results in strong dedication. But you still need to sort the slackers from the workers. Invest time in the right persons, and train them to become better so when you need a stand-in for yourself, when you move to the next store, you can pick from your home-grown talents.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Optimise the store</h2>The difference between a good store and a great store is in the details. Optimise your stock by removing poor-selling articles, and ordering more of the good ones. Make sure your inventory doesn\u2019t run out but make sure you don\u2019t order too much either. Optimise the prizes to increase your revenue. Find the customer patterns and adjust the opening hours accordingly. Plan an efficient staff schedule, so you don't pay people for doing nothing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Corporation Mode</h2>Control multiple stores in various parts of the city. Adapt and buy the right articles for the locals. Expand your headquarters and evolve your concepts. Find the right managers, and ensure that you make the right investments at the right time.<br><br>Are you ready to take on the challenge?", "genre": ["Casual", "Indie", "Simulation", "Early Access"], "metacritic_url": null, "metacritic_score": null, "coming_soon": false, "date": "26 Mar, 2019"},

You and six other unlucky souls will do everything possible to escape and survive while the most well-known killer in the world tracks you down and brutally slaughters you.  Friday the 13th: The Game will strive to give every single player the tools to survive, escape or even try to take down the man who cannot be killed. Each and every gameplay session will give you an entirely new chance to prove if you have what it takes not only to survive, but to best the most prolific killer in cinema history, a slasher with more kills than any of his rivals!<br><br>Meanwhile, Jason will be given an array of abilities to track, hunt and kill his prey. Stalk from the shadows, scare your targets and kill them when the time is right in as brutal a fashion as you can imagine. Take control of the legendary killer that is Jason Voorhees and terrify those unfortunate enough to cross your path!<br><br><strong>Play as Jason Voorhees!</strong><br><br>For the first time ever, you will have the opportunity to play as Jason Voorhees, the most famous killer in horror. Stalk your prey, ambush them whenever you see fit and strike fear in the hearts of so many hapless victims as you become the legend himself! Friday the 13th: The Game will include a variety of kills, new and familiar, that will help you set the tone for the Jason Voorhees that you want to be. You\u2019ll even get to unlock various Jason incarnations from the movies!<br><br>Jason will be equipped with a terrifying array of abilities, giving you the control of a hunter at the height of his game. These are his woods, and he knows them all too well. Jason will not only feed off the fear of his victims, but will become stronger as the night progresses. The darker the night, the more terrifying Jason becomes!<br><br>Fans of the movies will be able to play as various versions of Jason, including: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Friday the 13th, Part II<br></li><li>Friday the 13th, Part III<br></li><li>Friday the 13th, Part VI: Jason Lives<br></li><li>Friday the 13th, Part VII: New Blood<br></li><li>Friday the 13th, Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan<br></li><li>Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday</li></ul><br><strong>How Will You Survive?</strong> <br><br>The entire focus of Friday the 13th: The Game is multiplayer. Survival is entirely up to you, the player, as you either stealthily hide from Jason or work together as a team to escape or bring the fight to Jason. Playing as a counselor is all about risk and reward, giving players multiple means of triumph over Jason! Want to hide in the woods as you wait for the police? Perhaps you want to band together and try to take on Jason as a group? Maybe you and a friend decide to fix the boat on the lake and escape while leaving everyone else to their fate? There are endless opportunities to survive the night, but every choice has a consequence. <br><br>Friday the 13th: The Game will continually set the pace of change, giving you unfamiliar surroundings while Jason Voorhees looks for his latest victim. No single strategy will ever be reliable, forcing players to adapt and change each time they begin their long night in Camp Blood! Be wary, you never know when or where Jason is going to strike!<br><br><strong>Play as the Counselors!</strong><br><br>We all remember the various tropes from Friday the 13th, and the game will be no exception! Each counselor type will have strengths and weaknesses, affording players the chance to excel in certain situations. Find the counselor that best suits your play style, or come up with various strategies to win against Jason! Players will have the chance to continually update and improve their characters through unlocks, customization and improvement! The more you play, the more you adapt and become a better all-around counselor!<br><br><strong>Camp Crystal Lake in All Its Glory!</strong><br><br>Mirroring Camp Crystal Lake from the Friday the 13th series, players will try to survive not only in the iconic Camp Crystal Lake, but surrounding area. Iconic locations from the movies, like Higgins Haven will also serve as stalking grounds for Jason and his prey. <br><br>Players will be given a large, open area in which to explore as they attempt to hide from certain death! Each gameplay session will fundamentally change the scenario, never affording players the opportunity to learn patterns or figure out where helpful items may be lying. With each movie giving a different feeling to the campgrounds, Friday the 13th: The Game gives you new and challenging situations every time you enter the woods!<br><br><strong>Your Crystal Lake Database</strong><br><br>Friday the 13th: The Game will feature a progressive unlock system unified to your account.

Get to know every cliff and crevice as you plan pistes, place lifts and build essential facilities. Take on the challenge to create a resort where life is always good!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Plan your pistes</h2><br>Place pistes on the mountainside in just a few clicks with the easy-to-use creation tool. Read the terrain, and choose the best spot to lay down trails for every skier ability.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1124260/extras/snow_header.gif?t=1619427531\" /><br>11 different types of ski lift give you plenty of choice for scaling the heights. 12-person gondola lifts are fast, but tricky to build on the steep mountain slopes. A two-person chairlift might be a better choice, but watch out for queues at the bottom!<br><br>Luckily, ever-advancing ski lift technology means there are always new options to try. The latest models can make even the highest peaks accessible in no time.<br><br>Plan, build and improve until you\u2019ve created your dream ski area.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1124260/extras/build2_gif.gif?t=1619427531\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Welcome skiers of every kind</h2><br>You might have thought perfect pistes were enough to keep skiers happy, but it\u2019s not so simple. With 12 different skier profiles in the game, some are more interested in a good raclette, while others come to commune with nature. And then there are the hardcore ski fanatics, who won\u2019t settle for anything less than the longest run the mountain has to offer.<br><br>There\u2019s no money in Snowtopia. Make your skiers happy enough and they might  join the team of volunteers running the resort. Divide your workforce between the lift operators, maintenance crew, service facilities, and resort improvement team.<br><br>Growing the reputation of your resort leads to more skiers on the slopes. But beware - more skiers means more accidents! Make sure you have enough snow groomers and ski patrols to keep the slopes safe at all times.<br><br>Remember, no one likes a broken chairlift, but everyone loves sunbathing on the terrace! <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1124260/extras/management2_gif.gif?t=1619427531\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sit back and chill on the mountain</h2><br>Once your resort is built and your skiers are happy, you deserve a little break. So find yourself a perfect little corner on the mountain to drink it all in, maybe near a pretty forest piste next to a ski lift perched on a picturesque clifftop.<br><br>You\u2019re in the mountains. Enjoy the frosty kiss of the cold air on your face and kick back to some cool tunes.<br><br>Welcome to Snowtopia, the game where it\u2019s good to just chill.", "genre": ["Indie", "Simulation", "Strategy", "Early Access"], "metacritic_url": null, "metacritic_score": null, "coming_soon": false, "date": "26 Jan, 2021"},

Fight either alone, or with your friends throughout the whole campaign, which is fully playable in Co-Op. <br>Action-oriented story, gripping gunfights, realistic weapons with an on-the-fly swappable attachment system. Immersion like you\u2019ve never felt before in a VR military shooter! <br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://springboardvr.com?game_verification=57f73140-5c47-11e9-8c45-959ed89ff02e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  > Available for Arcades on SpringboardVR </a><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">REALISTIC COMBAT SYSTEM - MOVE YOUR BODY TO FIGHT AND FIND COVER</h2><br>Handle, aim and reload your weapons with real-life movements! We modeled the in-game weapons based on their real-life counterparts paying extreme attention to detail. Each weapon has its unique reloading method that you have to learn and practice to fully master them. <br>If you fancy explosions, just grab a grenade and throw it at the enemy. After you pulled the pin of course.<br>Stay in the open for too long and you\u2019re dead. Try to find cover instead, duck, crouch, sneak, peek around a corner, clear obstacles with real-life movements. Military combat isn\u2019t all about shooting. Being aware of your surroundings, the terrain, and working together with your squadmates are all part of a successful mission. Don\u2019t let your fellow soldiers down!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">REALISTIC WEAPONS - CUSTOMIZE YOUR FAVOURITE GUN</h2><br>Everyone has a unique playstyle. Is accuracy your thing? Put a laser sight on your assault rifle and take accurate shots in semi-automatic mode, or just grab a sniper rifle. Are you more of a shoot first, ask later type of person? Take a shotgun, or dual wield your machine guns in fully automatic firing mode. Be careful though, recoil can make your job really difficult! Combine your favourite gun with your favourite attachments on-the-fly to find out which variation suits you the most!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE STORY - DIVE INTO AN ENGAGING DYSTOPIAN ADVENTURE IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE</h2> <br>Water is life. Someone should\u2019ve made that clear before humanity started poisoning Earth with microplastics. Now water is death. People are fighting for drinkable water, for survival.<br>The military tried their best to keep order, but inevitably they got overwhelmed. That\u2019s when mercenaries appeared.. then entire private armies.. and then when hope started to fade away came the religious cults. The most fearsome of all is a secretive organization worshipping Tlaloc, the aztec God of rain. The \u201cTlalokii\u201d, as they call themselves. Their motto? \u201cJoin us or perish\u201d. What is even worse, they know something that can change the fate of humanity.<br>Be part of this action-packed, story-driven VR adventure where you fight alongside your fellow soldiers trying to keep order\u2026 or what\u2019s left of it anyway.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STUNNING GRAPHICS</h2><br>We place realism above anything else. Graphics and ambiance are crucial parts of this, that\u2019s why we took extreme care in audio and visual design. Explorable open environment, stunning graphics, background noises, realistic weapon sound effects. <br><br><strong>A constantly developing military VR FPS experience that will surely make you forget that you are in a video game!</strong>", "genre": ["Action", "Casual", "Indie", "Simulation", "Early Access"], "metacritic_url": null, "metacritic_score": null, "coming_soon": false, "date": "9 Nov, 2018"},

As all plans are subject to change, there is a great chance that the list will also end up changing, however.<br>The order of the roadmap is also subject to change as the development moves ahead. Some things listed may arrive a great deal sooner or later than what their listing order indicates.<br><br><strong>1. Bug fixes, stability improvements:</strong> This will be an ongoing focus throughout the development of the game. An alpha is never without its bugs. New content rarely comes without its fair share of bugs and issues required to fix up.<br><br><strong>2. Performance improvements:</strong> We are well aware of the performance of the alpha is needing to be improved - especially at higher playercounts. Major programming work is currently going into reworking the most expensive part of the game at high playercounts. Once finished you should all be experiencing much better framerates on populated servers.<br><br><strong>3. Expanded server moderation tools:</strong> This will allow server administrators more control to manage and configure their server using commands such as: kick,ban,change map, change skirmish area, change weather and time of day.<br><br><strong>4. End game events:</strong> Taken out just before the launch on Early Access, the end game events will be making a comeback in a more fleshed out form, specifically designed to create more memorable end game moments in cases where the question of who were the winners of the match is heavily contested.<br><br><strong>5. Improved melee:</strong> Melee is going to be receiving a much needed overhaul, including the availability of a parry move and animation kill sequences between two players (\u201ckill-moves\u201d) to increase the visual fidelity of close quarter fighting.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/424030/extras/Melee_650.jpg?t=1613070474\" /><br><br><strong>6. New battlefields:</strong> The Battles of South Mountain and Shepherdstown will eventually complete the Maryland Campaign of 1862.<br><br><strong>7. Fleshed out officer order system:</strong> Additional officer commands will be introduced to allow for a greater range of tactical options.<br><br><strong>8. Musicians:</strong> Working in tandem with the officer order system, musicians will have to relay the correct calls to help make sure the orders are received down the line.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/424030/extras/Musicians_650.jpg?t=1613070474\" /><br><br><strong>9. Historical Battles mode:</strong> Besides the quicker Skirmish mode, the largest and main game mode intended for the game, known as Historical Battles, would open up the entirety of the 4x4 km battlefields for more of a complete playthrough, with a moving frontline consisting of several capture areas. This will also entail the use of the full chain of command where players take the part of Generals, using maps and couriers to direct troops across the huge battlefield.<br><br><strong>10. Player controlled artillery:</strong> The many batteries already placed on the battlefields will become player controlled once we introduce an artillery system, where players will have access to some of the most destructive and tide-turning weapons of war.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/424030/extras/Skirmish_7_Maryland_Heights_650.jpg?t=1613070474\" /><br><br><strong>11. Generals:</strong> The chain of command on the battlefield will be expanded with the addition of generals. Generals bring a tactical overview to the battle that all other classes lack, helping to command the troops when using the historical battles mode, helping to bring some order to the chaos of war.<br><br><strong>12. Cavalry:</strong> Horses are to be implemented for both cavalry units, moving artillery pieces, as well as for the high command and their couriers. The cavalry was still an important branch of the armies of the period considering the changes in technology, acting as reconnaissance and quick response units as understandings for their use developed over the period of the war.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/424030/extras/Cavalry_650.jpg?t=1613070474\" /><br><br><strong>13. Final Release:</strong> Once the above features have been finished, we will be at the point that we would be just about ready for full release of the game to all and sundry! This final release would also be the point that those that had backed us originally would be getting their promised physical and digital goods. While we cannot give any definite date as to when we might get to release, we inch closer every day!", "genre": ["Action", "Indie", "Simulation", "Strategy", "Early Access"], "metacritic_url": null, "metacritic_score": null, "coming_soon": false, "date": "3 Dec, 2018"},

A whole new vector-graphics engine gives the game a more adaptable, cleaner user interface, and the fourth in the series builds on the past while adding a host of new features such as media reports, coalition governments, emergency powers, three-party systems and a more sophisticated simulation that handles inflation, corruption and modern policy ideas such as quantitative easing, helicopter money, universal basic income and policies to cover current political topics such as police body cameras, transgender rights and tons more.<br><br>Democracy 4 is the ultimate sandbox for testing out your political ideas. We all think our politicians are useless and that we could do a better job ourselves, but is that really true? With one eye on the budget, one-eye on the polls, and somehow finding time to watch out for terrorist attacks at the same time, you will find that staying in power while changing society for the better is a tougher job than you ever imagined.<br><br>Would it really be a good idea to legalize all drugs? to give the police machineguns? to ban abortion? to invest heavily in green energy? would UBI really work? can you stay elected after cutting pensions in half to pay for your science budget?

This is a strategy game, not a political protest :D. If you want to turn your country into ayn rand's fantasy, abolish all public spending and all taxes, you can do that. it might work, it might not! depending on how you handle it. On the other hand if you want to nationalise the railways, the energy companies, the water companies, cap CEO pay, ban second-home ownership and put universal income in place, you can do that too. All the game tries to do is model the *likely* effects, short and long term of any action you take.<br><br>Because modders have so enthusiastically supported earlier games in the series, we are doing our bet to make Democracy 4 as mod-friendly as possible too, and steam workshop support will make choosing and installing mods easy. Ultimately all our data is in text files that you can edit yourself, so if you think our analysis of the link between car tax and car usage is wrong (for example), its trivial to edit it, and share your changes with other players.<br><br>Ultimately Democracy 4 is not a game about simply winning an election, but about running the country. Losing an election is just  the end-game (unless you get assassinated), the real challenge to the game is whether or not you can create a country you are honestly proud of.

When these <strong><i>cyber violence</i></strong> continue to escalate, the consequences often exceed the incident itself, and even more stressful and end precious lives.<br>Therefore, we decided to develop such a game related to the theme of &quot;<strong><i>hacking</i></strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong><i>cyber manhunt</i></strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong><i>privacy data leakage</i></strong>&quot;. We hope that players can <strong><i>play the role of a hacker</i></strong>, and find out their <strong><i>privacy secrets</i></strong>, like God controls the destiny of others behind his back and witnesses their end.

You play a hacker to discover the truth of the incident one by one.<br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Summary</h2></strong><br>When we first decided on the theme of the game, we also considered it for a long time. Because of the better independent games such as <strong><i>This War of Mine</i></strong>, <strong><i>Papers, Please</i></strong> and <strong><i>Orwell</i></strong> etc., we also want to make a game that allows players to think outside the game. Therefore, in terms of subject matter, I also racked my brains.<br>And in order to give players a real hacking experience, we even established a social engineering group to find some professor in the industry and ask them about social engineering. I even read the book <strong><i>The Art of Deception</i></strong> by the famous hacker Kevin David Mitnick, and saw how the real hacker master works. These online and offline learning directly opened the door to a new world for everyone in our team. The disciplines involved include social engineering, psychology, micro-expressions, tactics, etc. The rich content also allows us full of confidence in the subject matter and gameplay of the game.<br>Not just professionals and books, we are also looking for inspiration in some film works. For example, through <strong><i>Who Am I: No System Is Safe</i></strong>, we have seen more artistic and more representative forms of hacking technology. Through <strong><i>Searching</i></strong> we have learned how to create reversals in details and how let the audience / player focus on where we expect them to focus. Every part of the learning has benefited us a lot, and we can't wait to use them in our games.<br><br>To sum up, this game is very <strong><i>special and unique</i></strong> which combines a lot of features. I really hope that you guys could like this game much.

Together, the two kingdoms have grown to become the most powerful in the world. But as we all know, power can corrupt even the most virtuous of souls.<br><br>As the ruler of Siralim, you just received word that King Lucius of Nex has obtained the Ultimate Nether Orb - a powerful relic that can be used to control the gods themselves.

For example, the Firewound Angel\u2019s \u201cPyre\u201d trait greatly increases the amount of damage it deals with basic attacks, and its attacks also afflict the target with the \u201cBurning\u201d debuff which causes damage over time.<br><br>Most creatures are obtained by encountering and defeating them in the wild. Afterward, you\u2019ll be able to summon them and use them in your party.

You can also change the floor and wall styles, and even unlock different songs that can be played in your castle.<br><br>You can also take on Projects to unlock new castle features, such as a battle arena, mini-games, and much more.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1289810/extras/s4_banner_07.png?t=1620056884\" /><br><br>Battles are turn-based and pit your six creatures against six enemy creatures. Each creature takes a turn in a certain order that is determined by their Speed stat.<br><br>During a creature\u2019s turn, they can do any of the following:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Attack: deals damage to the target based on the attacker\u2019s Attack stat.<br></li><li> Cast: choose from one of the creature\u2019s equipped spells to devastate your enemies or boost the strength of your party.<br></li><li> Defend: drastically reduces the amount of damage the creature will take until the start of its next turn.<br></li><li> Provoke: enemies will be forced to target the creature until the start of its next turn.</li></ul><br>These actions all interact with your creatures\u2019 traits as well. For example, one trait might cause a creature to deal damage to all enemies after it Defends.<br><br>After you win a battle, your creatures will gain experience points. In addition, you\u2019ll receive resources (currency) and maybe even some items.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1289810/extras/s4_banner_152.png?t=1620056884\" /><br><br>At the start of the game, players can choose from one of 30 different specializations for their character. Each specialization offers a unique list of unlockable perks that change the way your creatures fight in battle.<br><br>Here is a list of just a few of the specializations in the game, along with a brief description of how they work:<br><br>Animator - As an Animator, you will always have a unique creature in your party called Animatus. Your entire battle strategy will likely focus on this creature. You can empower your Animatus, and even use your other creatures to make it stronger in combat.<br><br>Cabalist - As a Cabalist, you'll enable your creatures to cast spells that they normally wouldn't have access to. While other people's creatures might run out of Spell Gem Charges, you'll be able to keep your creatures well-stocked with fresh Spell Gems at the start of every battle.<br><br>Cleric - As a Cleric, you'll specialize in healing abilities, as well as buffing, resurrection, stat-boosting effects, and providing your creatures with protective barriers. Your creatures will be extremely difficult to kill.<br><br>Defiler - As a Defiler, you'll specialize in debuffs and stat-reducing effects. Enemies will be so weak that your party will be able to easily pick them off, even if they were originally much more powerful than your creatures.<br><br>Druid - As a Druid, you'll probably only want to have one (or two, later on) creatures in your party. Your creatures will gain massive benefits for being part of a smaller party.<br><br>Evoker - As an Evoker, you'll empower your creatures' spellcasting capabilities. Your creatures will be able to cast the same spell multiple times in one turn, and these spells will be much stronger than if they had cast them without your guidance.<br><br>Hell Knight - As a Hell Knight, you'll favor creatures that specialize in attacking. Hell Knights empower their creatures' attacks with chaotic magic. Hell Knights are surprisingly adept at spellcasting in a pinch, as well.<br><br>Inquisitor - As an Inquisitor, you'll have a solution at your disposal for every problem you encounter. In addition, Inquisitors are able to use healing effects for offensive purposes - for example, when your creatures heal enemies, they instead cause damage to them.<br><br>Monk - As a Monk, you'll boost your creatures' chance to Dodge attacks and spells. When your creatures Dodge, they'll unleash a devastating counter-attack on the enemy.<br><br>Necromancer - As a Necromancer, you'll summon minions to aid your creatures in battle. These minions can do all kinds of things to support your creatures - they can cause damage, boost your creatures' stats, debuff enemies, and much more.<br><br>Paladin - As a Paladin, your creatures will be able to endure even the most powerful of attacks. Each time your creatures take damage, they'll also damage their enemies.<br><br>Reaver - As a Reaver, your creatures will gain massive benefits in combat as battles continue to drag on. If your creatures manage to survive for just a few extra turns, they'll be able to devastate your enemies.<br><br>Sorcerer - As a Sorcerer, you'll support your creatures by debilitating their enemies from afar. Generally, your enemies won't be able to act for the first few turns in battle as long as you're around.<br><br>Tribalist - As a Tribalist, you'll want to assemble a party of creatures that belong to the same race. This will provide them with significant benefits that are exacerbated by their racial synergies with each other.<br><br>Trickster - As a Trickster, you'll heavily inconvenience your enemies by preventing them from taking action. You'll also gain the ability to manipulate the element of luck - for example, if a positive effect has a chance to activate but fails to do so, you can try again.<br><br>Eventually, you can unlock all of these specializations on the same save file and quickly swap to them whenever you want.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1289810/extras/s4_banner_08.png?t=1620056884\" /><br><br>Each of your creatures can equip an Artifact. Artifacts provide your creatures with various bonuses, including stat boosts, on-damage effects/procs, traits, and even the ability to automatically cast spells when certain conditions are met.<br><br>In order to obtain an Artifact, you must first Forge one at the Blacksmith. After that, you can Socket your Artifacts with crafting materials to add new properties to them. There are over 1000 crafting materials to be found, and they all provide different properties. You can Upgrade your Artifacts to unlock new socket slots, and even Brand your Artifacts to give them a custom name.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1289810/extras/s4_banner_09.png?t=1620056884\" /><br><br>Your creatures can equip Spell Gems which allow them to cast the spell contained within the gem. There are more than 700 different spells for players to find.<br><br>In order to obtain Spell Gems, you must first find an Inscription that acts as a recipe to teach you how to Craft the Spell Gem. You can Upgrade your Spell Gems to unlock Enchantment slots, and then you can use these slots to add properties that affect the way the spell works.<br><br>For example, you can add a modifier to a Spell Gem that allows it to deal damage to an additional enemy. Another interesting property is called \u201cMagnetic\u201d, which causes the spell to be more powerful for each creature in your party that has that same spell equipped.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1289810/extras/s4_banner_10.png?t=1620056884\" /><br><br>Unlike other games, Siralim Ultimate allows you to decide when you\u2019ve finished it. For that reason, we\u2019ve packed the game with a ridiculous amount of content to explore, items to collect, achievements to earn, and so much more. Many players have enjoyed the previous Siralim games for thousands of hours (that's not an exaggeration) and Siralim Ultimate is going to be even larger in scale. There will always be something new for you to collect, no matter how long you\u2019ve been playing!<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1289810/extras/s4_banner_11.png?t=1620056884\" /><br><br>Each of the 30 realms in Siralim Ultimate is ruled by a different god. Players can earn Favor with these gods to increase their Favor Rank. As your Favor Rank with each god increases, you\u2019ll be able to earn new items, creatures, decorations, and much more.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1289810/extras/s4_banner_12.png?t=1620056884\" /><br><br>Almost every gameplay system in Siralim Ultimate is meant to last players forever - or at least for a very, very long time. For example, your creatures do not have a level cap, so you can continue to level them up and make them stronger indefinitely. Similarly, enemies can scale infinitely as well.<br><br>Post-story content is filled to the brim with countless activities for you to partake in to make your creatures more powerful. Here are a few examples:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Take on randomly generated side quests to obtain unique creatures and items.<br></li><li>Draft a team of creatures in the arena and see how many battles you can last before your final creature falls.<br></li><li>Battle against the gods themselves! These super boss-style fights are among the most challenging in the game\u2026 but also the most rewarding.<br></li><li>Unlock the relics of the gods and upgrade them indefinitely to unleash devastating powers upon your foes.<br></li><li>Encounter Rodian Creature Masters in Realms. Defeat them to earn Mastery, items, achievements, and much more!<br></li><li>Work with five different guilds to take on powerful False Gods<br></li><li>Collect skins and accessories for your creatures to customize their appearance.<br></li><li>Collect cards to unlock permanent bonuses for all your creatures. There's a card for every creature in the game!<br></li><li>Collect Nether Stones, which are Diablo-inspired, randomly generated items that can be socketed into your Artifacts to grant them unimaginable power.<br></li><li>Partake in mini-games such as slot machines, keno, scratch cards, and even a board game that rewards you with exclusive items.<br></li><li>Use Realmshaping to unlock new events and perks in each of the 30 realms.<br></li><li>Defeat enemies to gain Knowledge about them, unlocking additional benefits when you next encounter that creature in the wild.</li></ul><br>The list goes on and on and on, and we have plans to add even more end-game content in the future as well. The point is, Siralim Ultimate isn\u2019t a game where you\u2019ll finish the main storyline and then call it quits. There\u2019s so much content for you to discover afterward that it\u2019s almost ridiculous!", "genre": ["Indie", "RPG", "Early Access"], "metacritic_url": null, "metacritic_score": null, "coming_soon": false, "date": "12 Mar, 2021"},

The peoples of these regions came collectively to be known as the Anglo Saxons.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/712100/extras/Alfred_The_Lad.jpg?t=1603130658\" /><br><br><strong>West Seaxe</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: King Alfred</strong><br><br>As the dominant Anglo-Saxon kingdom of southern England, the forces of West Seaxe \u2013 or Wessex in modern English \u2013 provided the isle\u2019s primary resistance against the incursions of the Great Heathen Army. From the capital city of Winchester, Wessex conquered lands in Surrey, Sussex, Kent, Essex and even Mercia. Alfred\u2019s dogged defense of the Danish invasion laid the foundations for Wessex to unite England under one ruler for the first time in 927 AD.<br><br><strong>Mierce</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Ceowulf</strong><br><br>From its capital city of Tamworth, the kings of Mierce \u2013 known now as Merica - ruled the area now known as the Midlands. At its height, Mierce stretched from Northumbria in the north of England to Kent, Sussex and Wessex to the south. In 877 AD, the Great Heathen Army seized the eastern part of the kingdom to form the Danelaw, or East Engle.<br><br><strong>The Gaels \u2013 Mide and Circenn</strong><br><br>Gaelic culture initially developed in Ireland, their society built around a system of clans and chieftains. They raided and traded with Roman settlements, and by 878 AD had expanded from Ireland to inhabit much of Scotland.<br>With the influx of the Vikings, some raiders settled in Gaelic lands, becoming the Norse-Gaels. The Scottish Gaels would absorb the Picts to become the Kingdom of Alba \u2013 essentially setting the blueprint for modern Scotland. <br><br><strong>Mide</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: King Flann Sinna</strong><br><br>Mide lies at the heart of Ireland. Not just geographically, but politically, intellectually and spiritually. Many High Kings have risen from Mide, and its current ruler, Flann Sinna, aspires to that title.<br><br>With many fellow Irish factions nearby, Mide is in a position to potentially bring the disparate clans together, and usher in an era of Irish prosperity. However, threats are never far away\u2026 the Vikings of Dyflin have settled to the east, and their power and influence are growing. Will Mide strive to keep the uneasy peace? Unite the clans in a war against these Norse settlers? Or find some other route to supremacy?  <br><br><strong>Circenn</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: \u00c1ed mac Cin\u00e1eda</strong><br><br>Circenn was in origin Pictish, but became more heavily influenced by the Gaels and other peoples over time as they were driven away from the relentless Viking raids. 878 AD marked the end of the Viking invasions, but Circenn\u2019s troubles were far from over. While she had a firm hold over the eastern coast of Scotland, many threats still exist \u2013 both within and without.   <br><br>Scoan, the capital of Circenn, was once home to the legendary Stone of Destiny, said to bestow divine strength on her people. Where the stone now resides is a mystery, but if clues can be found, surely the Stone\u2019s recovery would be an adventure worth undertaking\u2026<br><br><strong>The Welsh \u2013 Gwined and Strat Clut</strong><br><br>The Welsh Kingdoms descended from the Celtic Britons who occupied much of the island of Britain from the Iron Age, into and beyond its Romanisation in the First Century. <br><br>Ironically, the term \u2018Welsh\u2019 derives from the Anglo-Saxon term for foreigner, \u2018wealas\u2019, which they applied to the native Britons. The Anglo-Saxons flourished and many of the old Brittonic kingdoms began to disappear. <br><br><strong>Gwined</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: King Anaraut</strong><br><br>The people of Gwined have some claim to the title of 'true Britons', having been driven to the far west by invaders who now call themselves \u2018English\u2019. Renowned both for their bardic arts and their skill with the longbow, the Welsh of Gwined thrived under the leadership of Rhodri Mawr. <br><br>Rhodri kept Gwined largely free of Vikings and other invaders while expanding its borders. Now he is gone and his lands are divided. <br><br><strong>Strat Clut</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Run</strong><br><br>Strat Clut is a kingdom of the Old North that can be traced back to the Fifth Century and the Celtic Britons. The realm was formerly based at the fortress of Alt Clut but driven out by a Viking invasion in 870. The current King Artgal was taken captive and reportedly killed in mysterious circumstances. The kingdom reformed further into the valley of the River Clyde under the leadership of his only son Run.<br><br><strong>The Great Viking Army \u2013 Northymbre and East Engle</strong><br><br>In 865 AD, Ragnar\u2019s sons led the Great Viking Army and made landfall in East Anglia. Over the next 15 years the Vikings ranged high and low, from Wessex to The Clyde, conquering towns, claiming victories and suffering their share of defeats until the Battle of Edington in 878 AD, where its leader Guthrum met his match in the young King Alfred and his West Saxon army. Bested in the field, his forces retreated in disarray to a nearby fortress. Flush with success, Alfred\u2019s men gave chase and laid siege. After a fortnight of starvation, the invaders surrendered.<br><br>Under the terms of his capitulation, Guthrum was baptised into Christianity and he and his men were allowed to return to East Anglia and settle \u2013 provided they kept Alfred\u2019s peace, of course.<br>Defeated, but never humbled, the Vikings seethe with an all-consuming rage. One does not cage the wolf without consequence\u2026<br><br><strong>Northymbre</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Guthfrid</strong><br><br>When the Vikings arrived in Northumbria in 867 AD, they took the city of York \u2013 or Eoferwic, as was \u2013 for their stronghold. And what a bastion it was, with its formidable Roman walls still standing strong 700 years on. King Aelle of Northumbria attempted to wrest the city back from the Danes, but was captured during the attack. In retribution for Aelle\u2019s execution of their father, the sons of Ragnar made an example of him with the horrifying Blood Eagle ritual.<br><br>Northumbria remained under Viking control and, after the battle of Edington and the subsequent treaty of Wedmore, a portion of the Great Viking Army marched back to Northumbria, to settle under Alfred\u2019s peace.<br><br><strong>East Engle</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Guthrum</strong><br><br>Forming the bulk of Britannia\u2019s south-easterly coast, East Engle was the staging-point of the Great Viking Army\u2019s invasion, and the region where many of its warriors settled after the Battle of Edington. Under the rule of the Danish leader Guthrum (or \u00c6thelstan, to use his adoptive name by Alfred) it would ultimately come to be known as the Danelaw.<br>Yet still, some fight remains in the Danes of East Engle. One does not shed the mantle of glory and become a landsman overnight.<br><br><strong>The Viking Sea Kings \u2013 Dyflin and Sudreyar</strong><br><br>After nearly a century of escalating raids, the Vikings left an indelible stamp on Britannia, altering the course of its history forever. Not least of all culturally, as many smaller bands of Vikings had settled around the isles prior to Alfred\u2019s defeat of the Great Viking army.<br>These smaller factions traded an existence of ceaseless conflict for a new life in Britannia, establishing their own petty principalities, intermarrying and ultimately becoming part of the warp-and-woof of Britannic life. This mingling of cultures, so emblematic of British history, helped create the rich melting-pot of attitudes, beliefs and language that has made the isles and their people so unique.<br><br>Some Vikings never truly settled however; their designs were grander, their hunger for conquest and greatness unquenched. These Sea Kings would continue their bellicose work, heedless of any decree from England\u2019s upstart ruler\u2026<br><br><strong>Dyflin</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Bardr</strong><br><br>Dyflin was a major port town on the east coast of Ireland, and the site of Britannia\u2019s largest slave market. It was a major site of Viking occupation, and was ruled until 873 by the Viking lord Imar, often associated with Ivar the Boneless, a son of the legendary Viking warlord Ragnar Lothbrok. Viking raiders had wintered there as early as 840 AD, so their association with the region had been a long one, and over time their customs began to take on a more Gaelic flavour as the slow process of integration took its course. <br><br>By 878 AD however, Imar\u2019s son Bardr was firmly established on the throne. Would this ambitious Viking ruler seek to seal a lasting peace with the surrounding Gaelic factions? Or return to the ways of Ragnar, and pursue a path of bloodshed and domination? It is hard to ignore the calling of one\u2019s warrior-blood\u2026 <br><br><strong>Sudreyar</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Eirik</strong><br><br>To the west of Alba lies Sudreyar, the Kingdom of the Southern Isles. Comprising the southern Hebrides, these scattered islands were sparsely populated and, bearing the full brunt of the Atlantic weather, were not lands suited to the less-hardy.<br><br>Like much of Britannia, these islands saw increasing Viking contact from the 8th Century. Prior to this period they formed part of the Gaelic kingdom of Dalriada, until they fell under Viking control. Over the next century, Scandinavian occupancy took on a distinctly Gaelic flavour (and vice-versa), particularly after 872 AD when Harald Fairhair became king of Norway, and his former opponents flocked to the area.<br><br>Materially poor, but offering an excellent base for those of a nautical bent, the isles of Sudreyar are a perfect staging-post for raiders and explorers.", "genre": ["Action", "Strategy"], "metacritic_url": null, "metacritic_score": null, "coming_soon": false, "date": "2 May, 2018"},

But now it's got a 2 in front of it!<br><br>Rogue Legacy 2 is a genealogical rogue-LITE. That means it has all the trappings of a typical rogue-like (randomized runs, changing characters, and more), but with persistent upgrades, and persistent dead heirs.  In this game, your legacy defines you.  Spend your parents\u2019 inheritance and grow the family manor to give your children a better fighting chance.  Each child is unique, with their own traits and abilities.  Your daughter could be an archer.  She could also be a Vegan.  Rogue Legacy 2 also lets you play how you want to.  Go hard and fast, and you can dive deeper into the depths of a randomly-generated world.  Or take it slow and steady, and build your character up until you\u2019re ready for greater challenges.  <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1253920/extras/rl1_header.png?t=1621357647\" /><br><br>Haven\u2019t played the first one?  In that case, here's what (the original) Rogue Legacy IS ALL ABOUT:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>An adventure that takes place in a randomly generated world. The entire kingdom changes with every life, so no two runs are the same.<br></li><li>Rogue-LITE. This is not your average roguelike because even in death, not all is lost.  Instead, you can build your manor, improve your legacy through an in-depth skill tree, and make each child stronger than the last. The game can be beaten at level 1, but that doesn't mean it has to.<br></li><li>Every heir is unique. Some might have Synethesia, where sounds can be perceived as colours, others might be contrary pacifists, and some could just be a little chubby. <br></li><li>Equip your heroes with powerful weaponry and armor. Or gain new abilities like flight, dash, and air jumping.<br></li><li>Clowns.</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1253920/extras/rl2_header.png?t=1621357647\" /><br><br>That\u2019s fine and dandy, but what about the sequel?  Here\u2019s what\u2019s NEW with Rogue Legacy TWO:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Brand New Style</h2>We\u2019re taking a whole new artistic approach to Rogue Legacy 2. The sequel features 2.5D stylings, with 3D characters against hand-drawn backdrops.  The art uses heavy shading and all animations are done using stepping techniques to keep the familiar RL look and feel.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unique Weapons</h2>On top of new abilities, classes now have weapons that completely alter how they play.  Rangers use bows, Lancers have multi-directional swings, and chefs throws ladles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Revamped Biome Generation</h2>We went all-out with biome generation to make each area in RL2 feel completely new.  Each biome adopts different \u201cbuild strategies\u201d to create completely unique yet-still-randomly-generated regions.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1253920/extras/EnvironmentBanner.png?t=1621357647\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">True Metroidvania</h2>To really push the metroidvania flair, RL2 introduces heirlooms: special items that permanently give your heroes new abilities that fully reveal the world\u2019s secrets.  These are not basic lock-in-key abilities, but powers that fundamentally change how you play.  And heirlooms are not simply handed to you.  You must prove your worth, provided you can find them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Traits 2.0</h2>Through the powers of Socialism we\u2019re bringing in the Universal Healthcare System, which adds a gold gain modifier to some traits.  The more debilitating the trait is (in-game), the bigger the reward.  This makes choosing your heirs a meaningful decision every time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Improved Accessibility</h2>RL1 was always designed for accessibility, by catering to both the hardcore players through skilled gameplay, and the more casual with a detailed level up system.  However, in some cases progression could still hit a wall, so we\u2019ve introduced new mechanics such as Off-shore Banking to give struggling players more ways to succeed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">More of everything</h2>Of course we\u2019re also adding more of everything people loved from the original Rogue Legacy.  More traits, more spells, more classes, more biomes, more enemies, more equipment, more rooms, more story.  Just more everything.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Clownathropy</h2>More clown.<br><br><br><strong>AND THERE'S A WHOLE LOT MORE.</strong> But we're still working on them through Early Access, and we'd like to keep a few secrets in our back pocket. :)<br><br>Early Access may be temporary, but Rogue Legacy is forever!<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1253920/extras/blacksmith_small.gif?t=1621357647\" />", "genre": ["Action", "Adventure", "Indie", "RPG", "Early Access"], "metacritic_url": null, "metacritic_score": null, "coming_soon": false, "date": "18 Aug, 2020"},

These players are randomly divided into alignments - Town, Mafia, Serial Killers, Arsonists and Neutrals. If you are a Town member (the good guys) you must track down the Mafia and other villains before they kill you. The catch?

Do the viking raiders make off with your villagers? Or are they stopped, full of arrows, at the castle gates? Does a dragon torch your granary, your people dying of starvation in the winter, or are you able to turn the beast back? The success of your kingdom depends solely on your skill as a city and castle planner.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/569480/extras/cd.png?t=1598199208\" /><br>Strategically layout your town to improve your peasants' happiness and to attract new residents. Tax them just enough to fund your castle. Make sure your peasants are fed in the winter and healed of plagues. Build churches to keep them from despair and taverns to keep them happy. You can even throw festivals if you've built a town square! Send out wood cutters to collect wood, set up stone quarries to build your castles, and farm the land efficiently so your town can grow and thrive.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/569480/extras/banner_city.jpg?t=1598199208\" /><br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/569480/extras/rect7730-4-ff2.png?t=1598199208\" /><br>The new land you're settling is at risk of viking invasion. These raiders seek to kidnap and kill your peasants, steal your resources, and burn your town to the ground. Use a powerful castle building system where castles are constructed using blocks which can be placed anywhere. Towers and walls are dynamically created based on how you stack and arrange them. Archer towers and other weapon emplacements have longer range the higher their tower. Try different layouts to best protect your kingdom and express your glory as a king or queen.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/569480/extras/banner_castle.jpg?t=1598199208\" /><br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/569480/extras/text4275-2-6.png?t=1598199208\" /><br>And it all takes place in a beautiful dynamic world with a stylized procedural cloud system and season cycle from summer to winter.

Now, the restless rascals at WarfareSims are back at it with a vengeance! The already legendary game of modern cross-domain operations returns with an all-new UI, even more refined simulation mechanics and a host of new features and content to engross you into the challenges of warfare post-WW2 and in the 21st century. Are you <strong>ready</strong>?

Over half a terabyte's worth of satellite imagery and terrain elevation combine to deliver an unprecedentedly crisp battlefield for your forces to roam.   <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1076160/extras/3-Command-MO.jpg?t=1620909082\" /><br>Command's new slick, dark-themed UI slams you right into the seat of a modern-day military command center and never lets go.

Your war machines are crewed or remote-controlled by human beings: people trained with varied proficiency (from novice to ace), operating under custom doctrine and rules of engagement (when to do what, how to decide, how to react etc.), most of the time making the rational decision, and sometimes making a brilliant call or a mistake. These people often matter far more than the hardware.

{"game_id": 252690, "name": "Fantasy Grounds Classic", "required_age": 0, "developers": ["SmiteWorks USA, LLC"], "is_free": false, "about_the_game": "Fantasy Grounds is an application acting as a virtual online gaming table primarily intended for pen and paper style narrative role playing games.  It is designed to perform many of the things you can do while playing at a conventional gaming table and move it online.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Shop DLC in the updated Steam Store</h2>You can browse by category more easily from the SmiteWorks Publish Page link below.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/252690/Fantasy_Grounds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >BROWSE DLC</a>.</h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Note about DLC for Fantasy Grounds</h2>Fantasy Grounds has a wealth of DLC available as add-ons. Each of these DLC add-ons expands Fantasy Grounds to support a brand new game system or to add new adventures and supplements from your favorite game publishers and artists. SmiteWorks has negotiated license deals with several dozen different RPG Game publishers and artists, both large and small, to bring you a very large variety of gaming options. Our agreements with these publishers and artists provide royalties for every purchase made through Steam and elsewhere, so that a purchase of DLC for Fantasy Grounds is the equivalent to or better for the publisher than walking into a game store or book store and buying a physical book from the publisher. Each and every purchase is directly helping fund and grow the RPG hobby industry. <br><br>The share that SmiteWorks retains for this helps pay our content and programming developers and helps us add support for more and more games. In many cases, the content you can buy as DLC can be built directly by you within Fantasy Grounds if you already own the material in another form. The DLC provides a convenient option for time-strapped gamers who also wish to directly support the gaming industry.<br><br><br>* This is not a stand-alone game. This game features no computer controlled AI and relies upon another user acting as a Gamemaster to control the story, action and enemies you face.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overview</h2>Fantasy Grounds is a hybrid application which allows you to play and create your own RPG games. It facilitates this play and provides some optional add-on Adventure modules which can be loaded and played with very little preparation. Each game will require a GameMaster (GM) and one or more players. Games may be played in a session as short as a few hours or continued with multiple sessions over a series of days, weeks, months or years. A GM will typically install the application and choose their game-system of choice, which we refer to as a Ruleset. Fantasy Grounds comes pre-loaded with Rulesets supporting compatible play for Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2E, Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3.5, Dungeons &amp; Dragons 4E, Dungeons &amp; Dragons fifth edition and the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game (R). Additional Rulesets are available for free and for purchase from our Workshop. The 3.5E, 5E and PFRPG rulesets are good places to start for new GMs and for people new to Fantasy Grounds. These Rulesets come pre-loaded with some basic Library modules full of abilities, spells, monsters and items that have been marked as Open Gaming Content (OGC) by their respective copyright holders.  The 5E ruleset contains all the content from the D&amp;D Basic Rules for D&amp;D fifth edition. Additional rulesets, such as that for Call of Cthulhu or Savage Worlds are fully licensed versions and contain otherwise closed and proprietary content that we've licensed from those publishers. As of April 2015, Fantasy Grounds acquired an official license from Wizards of the Coast for D&amp;D fifth edition. This means that the 5E ruleset supports basic understanding and gameplay for D&amp;D fifth edition but you can also buy fully preloaded data packs and adventures that are licensed from Wizards of the Coast as DLC here on Steam.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Players</h2>For players, Fantasy Grounds will allow you to connect to a game being hosted by a GM and control one or more characters within the game. You will be able to update and maintain your character sheet, much like you would in a face-to-face RPG game, but with some degree of automation and support for dragging and dropping abilities and items from the Library modules (for rulesets which support them.) Whenever a GM shares a map image, you will be able to move a token representing your character and initiate attack rolls against enemies visible on those maps when it is your turn. You will be interacting within the GM's game session with other players and every action you take will be communicated to the GM and connected players along with any chat messages you enter into the chat window. At the conclusion of the GM's game session, you will log out and your character sheet and progress will be saved to the GM's session. When you meet back up and a pre-scheduled time with the GM for the next session, you will be able to continue where you left off.  Scheduling of future game sessions is handled outside of Fantasy Grounds via email communication, the Fantasy Grounds forums and Game Calendar, Steam discussions or through whatever source the GM defines.  SmiteWorks hopes to improve the match-making features at a later date.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GameMasters</h2>For GameMasters, Fantasy Grounds will allow you to outline and prepare your future game sessions. You will be able to create story entries and link them together or to specific maps. You could, for instance, create a story entry which links to an image of a dungeon and then each room could in turn be linked to individual story entries -- each containing room descriptions, secret GM notes, a list of NPCs and monster encounters or links to more images and player hand-outs. Depending on your game master style and the availability of pre-entered monsters and enemies, you can also run without preparation. You can create and maintain multiple Campaigns, each with their own content and players. When you are ready to run your campaign, you will need to spend some time recruiting players and establishing your preferred frequency and length of play, methods of communication when you are not connected with Fantasy Grounds and whether or not you want to use a voice application such as Skype or Google Hangouts alongside Fantasy Grounds. Most GMs tend to use a combination of in-game text-based chat within Fantasy Grounds *and* a voice application to help facilitate quicker and more natural play.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">With this version of the product, you can:</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Run games as the Gamemaster (GM)<br></li><li>Host games as a GM for other players and GMs who are connected as players<br></li><li>Host a demo game for 1 player who is using only the FG Demo.

You will be held accountable when things go wrong and filthy rich when things go right.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/673610/extras/the_gameplay.png?t=1623191955\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Running an airport</h2>Your objective is to build and manage your airport to perfection by making strategic decisions, designing the optimal airport layout and ultimately making sure that your passengers and airlines are satisfied. You will need to build the entire airport from scratch including terminal foundations with floors, walls, doors and items as well as the airport infrastructure including runways, taxiways, aprons and other airport infrastructure. Everything in Airport CEO is deeply simulated and it is your job to make sure it all runs smoothly and with a positive bank account.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Airlines</h2>Airlines and their travelers are an essential element of Airport CEO as they consist of the main source of your airport\u2019s income. Signing contracts with airlines bring cash-flow and passengers to your airport which in term means opportunities for receiving different service fees, as well as passenger expenditures. Airlines come in different sizes and have different requirements on your airport and the services you offer, you are responsible for not only planning the flight schedule but also for meeting and maintaining the needs. Occasionally you will need to handle emergencies and delays due to bad weather or accidents in the area, all which will put your management skills to the test.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/673610/extras/passengers_employees.png?t=1623191955\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Passengers</h2>Passengers in Airport CEO all have their unique personalities, needs, a background story and most importantly; a flight to catch (on time). Passengers are thoroughly simulated and their decisions, behaviors and opinions about your airport are affected by several factors. Passengers in Airport CEO, just as in real life, must wait in lines, check in, pass security and then entertain themselves until their flight is ready for boarding. Arriving passengers must find their way the baggage claim, get a hold of their bags and maybe pass a customs booth before getting on their airport transfer. Whether they\u2019ll be able to actually catch their flight is up to you: Passengers might have a hard time finding their way around the airport so you build an information desk, passengers might get irritated because of the long security queue and waiting time so you extend its capacity, passengers might complain about the lack of fun things to do in the gate area so you build a duty-free shop or exclusive brand boutiques.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Employees</h2>Employees are those you rely on to keep your airport running. Just as passengers they are simulated individuals who have a mind of their own. Employees have a number of different roles and it is your job to make sure that your airport has the right and necessary work force at any time. From passenger service agents, janitors, ramp agents and mechanics, security officers to administrators and executives. The more you expand your airport\u2019s capacity and services, the more versatile and skilled your employees have to be. When employees interact with passengers, they\u2019ll have to be skilled at managing people and stress resistant in order to avoid making mistakes or give bad customer service.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/673610/extras/facilities_ceo.png?t=1623191955\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Facilities and buildings</h2>Airports are complex mega-structures with a lot of different buildings and facilities. While a small airport might not need more than a simple grass runway and a terminal, as you grow your airport you will have to expand its facilities ranging from air control towers, larger aircraft stands and taxiways to fire, weather, catering or fuel stations. As your airport grows your terminal grows with it and you will have to make sure that it is equipped with the necessary facilities that passengers are expecting. Building a terminal in Airport CEO is highly customizable where you lay out its shape and interior such floor type, walls, windows and doors. Baggage needs to be processed and transported to the same flight as its owner and its all up to you to avoid bottlenecks and by designing the ultimate airport terminal.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Being a CEO</h2>Data, data, data! As the acting CEO of your airport you need to be able to make difficult business decisions based on current operation. In Airport CEO you\u2019re provided with multiple sources of information from which you can draw conclusions and manage your airport. As the CEO you will not only be responsible for the architecture of the airport but also for those working in it. Tired of planning every flight? Establish an informatics department and let an automated system do it for you! Tired of assessing the monthly budget balance? Hire a CFO which can help you cut cost and set prices.

Influence their decisions and punish the unfaithful with a wide range of godly abilities. Interact with objects, create disasters, and launch clueless creatures into orbit.

Help them, and they will soon begin writing their own history in the stars. Every Nugget is a unique individual with a distinct set of characteristics. Just like any other living creature, Nuggets must have access to a few vital resources in order to survive. This includes water to drink, food to eat, and recreational activities to increase their happiness and quality of life. Recreational activities may include blowing stuff up. You\u2019ve been warned.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/352720/extras/Nuggets.png?t=1622209719\" /><br><br>As you spend time with the Nuggets, you will begin to notice that they behave like natural, living beings. They have their own thoughts and needs, as well as the ability to act in dynamic and interesting ways. <br><br>While the beginning of the game will require more management to ensure the survival of your civilization, Nuggets will slowly evolve and learn how to handle more tasks on their own, resulting in you being able to switch over to a more macro-level role and tackle even greater challenges. <br><br><br><br><strong>ORGANIC GAMEPLAY</strong><br><br>Planets in The Universim aren\u2019t just made up of a bunch of neatly-arranged objects; everything is linked together and plays a unique role in each planet\u2019s ecosystem. Every tree your civilization cuts down, every resource they mine and every animal they hunt will affect the world they\u2019re living in. A lack of trees and high levels of pollution will raise the global temperature over time, while reckless hunting or fishing might cause the extinction of some species. It\u2019s your mission to manage how the Nuggets collect and utilize resources. What mark will you leave on the ecosystems that existed millions of years before your arrival? Will you use every available resource and expand at an unprecedented pace, or will you methodically create a more sustainable way of life for your civilization?<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/352720/extras/Organic.png?t=1622209719\" /><br><br><br><strong>NATURE AS YOU KNOW IT</strong><br><br>In The Universim, nature is just as wonderful and unpredictable as ever. Every planet comes with a few surprises that are sure to challenge your civilization. From tornadoes that consume everything in their path, to thunderous earthquakes that threaten to split your civilization in two. If you treat nature poorly, it might just show you how brutal and unforgiving it can be. Each planet you encounter will have a unique underbelly. Some planets are tranquil and filled to the brim with resources, while others are barren and dangerous. Be careful out there!<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/352720/extras/Nature.png?t=1622209719\" /><br><br>Something as simple as the cycle between night and day can play an important role. Wild animal attacks are more common at night, as are frequent temperature drops. Daytime offers a little more safety from the harshness of the world. With the inclusion of a full, four-season cycle, a planet\u2019s biomes can change drastically, making it extremely difficult for Nuggets to survive brutal winters without proper preparation ahead of time.<br><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/crytivo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  ><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/352720/extras/Twitter.png?t=1622209719\" /></a> <br><br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://facebook.com/crytivo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  ><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/352720/extras/Facebook.png?t=1622209719\" /></a><br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/crytivo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  ><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/352720/extras/Reddit.png?t=1622209719\" /></a><br><br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://eepurl.com/bKnqM1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  ><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/352720/extras/News.png?t=1622209719\" /></a><br><br>This game published by <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/Crytivo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Crytivo</a>", "genre": ["Indie", "Simulation", "Strategy", "Early Access"], "metacritic_url": null, "metacritic_score": null, "coming_soon": false, "date": "Aug 2018"},

While it may be tempting to overwhelm your opponents with sheer numbers, this leaves you at great risk of spreading yourself too thin and ultimately not being able to keep up.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/965580/extras/ROOT_Factions_Eyrie_Button.png?t=1621287241\" /><br>The <strong>Eyrie Dynasties</strong> once ruled the wood, before the coming of the Cats. They must retake control by capturing territory and building Roosts before they collapse back into squabbling. The Eyrie are proud and bound to the decrees of their leaders. Each leader brings with them different specialties and advantages. The right leader at the right time could lead you to victory, but the wrong leader could cripple your chances of reclaiming the forest.<br><br>During the Evening, the Eyrie score victory points based on the number of roosts on the map. The greater their presence in the Woodlands, the greater their gains. However, the Eyrie are bound by their Decree, an ever-increasing set of mandated actions promised by their leader. Each turn, they must take all of the actions on their Decree, or else fall into turmoil.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/965580/extras/ROOT_Factions_Alliance_Button.png?t=1621287241\" /><br>The <strong>Woodland Alliance</strong> doesn\u2019t take kindly to despots - old or new. Marquise, Eyrie, they\u2019re all the same. Only through the will of the people can this wood be ruled! The Woodland Alliance are masters of guerrilla warfare, they begin slowly but can build into a late-game powerhouse - but only if they can manage to subvert the other would-be rulers along the way.<br><br>The Woodland Alliance works to gain the sympathy of the various creatures of the forest. Each time the Alliance places a sympathy token, they may score victory points. The more sympathy on the map they have, the more victory points they score. Gaining the sympathy of the people requires supporters. These supporters can also be put toward violent ends, inciting outright rebellion across the forest. When a revolt erupts, the Alliance will establish a base. Bases allow the Alliance to train officers, increasing their military strength and flexibility.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/965580/extras/ROOT_Factions_Vagabond_Button.png?t=1621287241\" /><br>The <strong>Vagabond</strong> is an adventurer to some, a trader to others, and thief to more, and an all-around scoundrel. As the Vagabond, you will explore all over the map, beyond just it's clearings, into dense woods to find items and ruins. You can trade and lend aid to the warring factions of the forest to help you complete your own secret quests.<br><br>The Vagabond plays all sides of the conflict while going on quests to increase his renown throughout the wood. Each time the Vagabond improves their relationship with another faction, or removes a warrior belonging to a faction hostile toward them, the Vagabond scores victory points. You can also complete quests to score victory points. To move and act effectively the Vagabond must manage a pack of items, expand your selection by exploring the forest ruins and providing aid to other factions.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/965580/extras/RootFooter.png?t=1621287241\" />", "genre": ["Indie", "Simulation", "Strategy"], "metacritic_url": null, "metacritic_score": null, "coming_soon": false, "date": "24 Sep, 2020"},

In the 31st century the battlefields are dominated by immense and powerful mechanized units called BattleMechs. Join the ranks of elite operators tasked with piloting these war machines. Choose your path to becoming the most feared MechWarrior in the Inner Sphere, fighting for battlefield supremacy against other players.<br><br>Enter the Solaris Arena.<br><br>The newest addition to MechWarrior online\u2122, Solaris 7, features 1 vs 1 and 2 vs 2 Mech Combat across 7 Divisions. Choose your BattleMech wisely, each of the 7 Divisions has a limited roster of BattleMechs available based on the Mech\u2019s performance capabilities on the battlefield. Take a Patron Contract, pick up sponsors, and earn accolades as you climb to the top of the Divisions Leaderboards. Solaris 7 features 5 maps tailored for intense Mech Combat.<br><br>Quick Play is where you'll find fast action, fielding a single 'Mech in team-based game modes and maps. Unlike Faction Play, Quick Play matches do not influence the layout of Inner Sphere territories; these battles are fought purely for rewards and glory.<br><br>In Faction Play you will field 4 \u2018Mechs per match, lending your skills and allegiance to the Faction of your choosing in prolonged team-based engagements, conquering and defending planets in their name to earn rewards and expand your Faction's territory across the Inner Sphere.<br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay </h2></strong><br>Piloting a 'Mech to victory requires a mastery of tactical positioning, teamwork, and firing discipline. Strike out as a Lone Wolf or seek out one of the many player-controlled Units and fight under the banners of powerful galactic empires for prestige, wealth, or nothing more than the sheer thrill of battle. <br><br><strong>Next Gen Mobility </strong> - By the 31st century, tanks have evolved to take on humanoid shape, their treads replaced with nimble legs. Like modern tanks, 'Mechs move their upper torso and weapons independently of their legs offering unparalleled mobility while exchanging fire. Depending on their size, BattleMechs travel at vastly different speeds and offer different systems like jump jets to aid in their locomotion.<br><br><strong>Make Every Shot Count </strong> - Pilots must balance mobility and damage output against the amount of heat generated from their weapons fire and 'Mech operation, lest they risk the temporary loss of power that comes when a 'Mech overheats. Firing all weapons simultaneously (known as an Alpha Strike) can be the quickest way to devastate an opponent, but may leave a 'Mech helpless against its enemies if the heat sinks can't handle the stress.<br><br><strong>Fight Smart </strong> - 'Mechs possess both external armor and strong internal structural elements to help minimize the chance of a 'quick kill'. As a result, pilots must treat each encounter with the utmost attention and awareness, prioritizing weaker or more critical components before delivering the killing blow. Communication among teammates and the effective use of targeting systems can help to identify vulnerable 'Mechs and components.<br><br><strong>Teamwork is the Difference </strong> - Targeting a 'Mech will automatically allow your teammates to achieve their own lock, allowing them to ascertain vital location data, armor status, and loadout details for the targeted enemy. Information Warfare can be a vital component for victory, providing attack-focused allies with the necessary information to tear their opponents to pieces.<br><br><strong>Information Warfare</strong> - While fast-moving scouts feed target and tactical information back to the main battle group and the team commander, long-range Support and heavy-hitting Brawler and Assault \u2018Mechs will use this information to position themselves for the perfect strike. Pilots can also shield themselves and allies from enemy sensors and weapons fire using various counter measures. It is up to each pilot to customize their BattleMech loadout to fulfill their desired role. <br><br><strong>Find the perfect 'Mech </strong>- Hundreds of unique 'Mechs are available, offering a wide range of strengths and weaknesses. Smaller 'Mechs should never stop moving, and can rely on their sheer speed to overwhelm heavier opponents. Larger 'Mechs move slow and deliberate but can stand toe-to-toe with other large opponents. Acquire and test different 'Mechs to find those that best suit your play style.<br><br><strong>Choose Your Allegiance </strong> - Work for the powerful empires of the galaxy to earn their loyalty and spread their influence across the stars. Band together with other pilots using the Looking For Group feature, or use the Faction Chat feature to coordinate offensive and defensive strategies to capture or defend worlds and shift the balance of power.<br><br><strong>Get Rewarded </strong> - Pilots earn ComStar Bills (C-Bills) from playing matches and completing faction contracts, which can be used to purchase new 'Mechs and equipment.<br><br>Certain items can only be purchased using premium 'Mech Credits (MC). MC can either be purchased directly via real world money or acquired in smaller increments in-game by earning reputation with a Faction in Faction Play, or as rewards from participating in special Events.<br><br>'Mech Experience (XP) gained during combat is applied to the 'Mech used during that match, and can be used to unlock improvements to various BattleMech systems.<br><br>MechWarrior Online\u2122 also includes a host of achievements to unlock that will challenge even the most skilled players.", "genre": ["Action", "Free to Play", "Massively Multiplayer", "Simulation", "Strategy"], "metacritic_url": null, "metacritic_score": null, "coming_soon": false, "date": "10 Dec, 2015"},

Fed up with these constant attacks, the Borderland Clans called on the Empire for help \u2013 a powerful realm controlling the land from the Scarlett Mountains to Cynehelm Valley and the Hoarwood. The Western Imperial Legion was sent to face the highland raiders, and with the help of the Borderland clans Iseal and Machnar, killed High King Brendan in the battle of Wyrm\u2019s Pass.<br>A treaty was signed that forbade any clan from crossing into the Borderlands in return for peace. Since then, there has been no High King to unite the Clans, and they fell into quarrelling and raiding amongst themselves.<br>In these dark times your clan has been led by Falir One-Eye, a warrior of great renown.

The young clan members will need to be trained, and as they gain enough experience, even the greenest recruits can be turned into champions. But beware: costly victories can be worse than a defeat\u2026 when battle-hardened units perish, so does their progression and experience.<br>Each unit comes with their specific abilities, arms and armour, and they can be equipped with magic artefacts you find during battle and upgraded with gold and resources that you need to plunder from your enemy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Clans</h2>A confederation of autonomous hill-land tribes, who value their independence and will fight fiercely for it. <br>Field axemen, berserkers, spearmaidens, trolls and shamans, summon ancestor spirits and mighty elementals or train nimble stag riders and deadly werebears or recruit mercenaries from longbowmen to centaurs.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Empire</h2>The most powerful realm on the face of Aer.<br>Face the mighty Legions of the Empire and their magical creations from dragon cannons to golems as well as the Undead hordes they bring to battle, or fight harpies, lizard people and great dragons on your way.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The World</h2>The world of Aer is filled with beauty and wonders.
